LEDSignUpdater
==============

A simple python script for updating my Prolite PL-M2014R scrolling LED sign

___________________________________________________________________________

I have one of these signs in my living room, I got it from a previous job that had no use for it anymore, and I wanted to display some relevent data on it.

Currently script displays the time, weather and various stats about my Bitcoin mining rig.

Information about the protocol used to communicate with the sign can be found here:
